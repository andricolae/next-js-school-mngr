- PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
- Cloudinary account for media management
- Clerk account for authentication

> [!NOTE]
> All these services must be properly configured before the application can function correctly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-system.git
cd school-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. 🔒 Environment Configuration
   Create a .env file in the root directory

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/school_mgmt"

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard"

# Cloudinary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"

# Application Security
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never commit your .env or environment.ts file to version control. These files contain sensitive API keys and credentials that should remain private.

4. Database setup:

```bash
# Generate prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migration
npx prisma migrate dev --[name] init

# Seed the database with sample data
npx prisma db seed
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

// Automatic route protection
export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  const { sessionClaims } = auth();
  const role = sessionClaims?.metadata?.role;
  
  // Role-based redirects
  if (!allowedRoles.includes(role)) {

  }
});
```
